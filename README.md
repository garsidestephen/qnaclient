## Initialising
The following is an example of initialising the QNAClient plugin:-

    CreateQNAClient("84969b11b88449beb0cf2768f7b07597", "a7054a6d-0f82-4d8c-a9ae-9e4dca2b945d", {});

Thats it for a standard implementation!


## Configurable Parameters
The following are the configurable parameters for **QNAClient**, together with their defaults and a brief explanation:-

**"title"** :  ""  -  Displayed in the header bar of the chat window

**"minimumAcceptableAnswerScore"** : "50"  -  Used to calculate whether the top answer returned by your bot is an acceptable response. If all answers returned have a lower score then the '**noAnswer**' phrase is displayed in the chat stream.

**"pageContainerClass"** : ""  -  If present, QNAClient html will be injected into the dom element with this class.
